## 2. Literature research

Offline elevators Algorithm Optimization is one of the most discussable topics in the Computer Science Researchers.
After we researched to learn more about the Offline Elevators Algorithm Optimization we have found few relevant and interesting article, researches and video and there is our finding:

#### First article

This article purpose is to present complexity optional point of view of calculating Time Algorithms, and the differences between them. In the article there a brief summary of FCFS and SSTF – both different of a logical approach of allocating elevator. 
There is a presentation of LOOK and SCAN algorithms that works similarly but LOOK is a bit better than SCAN. 

* SCAN algorithm - is by going in one direction and handle all the calls there is at that direction and then change to the other direction and handle all the call at the other direction/
* Look algorithm - is more efficient due to its stops. If it doesn't have more calls at that direction he is in at a specific time it change its direction and handle the calls in the other direction.
* SAFT algorithm - calculating the time the customer had spent in the elevator as well.

#### Second article

This article is presenting in very simplify way and dealing with more generally subject surrounding tour topic. In the article is mention that today a lot of the elevators algorithms nowadays using AI to determent which way is the best way for this specific building algorithm.
There is even a video (source no. 5) that emphasize it and presenting a similar discussion with different types of building and elevators like our HW.

#### Third article

This article is a comparison between the five known Elevators algorithm before the current millennia:
1. MRF-Maximum Request First
2. FRF- First Request First
3. RAND-Random
4. CIRC -Circular
5. SDF - Shortest Destination First 


This comparison helps us to understand the importance of logic using and planning before one start to execute project at this huge size

#### Fourth article

This research is more widely speaking logically of the meaning of smart elevators. From the basics (at least today) like cyber defense for elevators and to calculating the expectancy of the efficiency calls by AI algorithm and personalization of the elevators for specific clients. The whole research is about efficiency in cases there is more than one elevator, because when we have only one elevator the work would be much simpler.

## 3. The algorithm

Our Algorithm is based on following every moment where is which elevator at any moment, and based on that the algorithm calculate on each call by its call_time which elevator is the best to allocate to this specific call.
The time calculation is based on two calculations functions.
First the algorithm calculate when the person is get into the elevator.
Second the algorithm calculate when the person will reach to his destination and get off the elevator.
By those two calculation on each elevator based on its current call_list we can find which elevator is the best fit to allocate it to each call.


## 4. Dependencies 
Those are the libraries we are using in our algorithm. Please make sure you have them updated for use our algorithm correctly:

* csv library - [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html)
* json library - [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html)
* sys library - [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html)

## 7. How to run the algorithm and the tests

How to rum our algorithm from the CMD:

```bash
python3 Ex1.py <Building.json> <Calls.csv> <output.csv>
```
To run the tests just go to the cmd and run this command line:
```cmd
java -jar Ex1_checker_V1.2_obf.jar 1111,2222,3333 <Building.json> <Calls.csv> <output.csv>
```
you can also run manually our tests for our algorithm and function in the file Tests.py
